Have a good idea?  Have a new project or a major feature?  How do you get started?

It is often difficult to know where to start, how to get a project off the ground.

Arron and Alan talk about some of the ways they accomplish this,
and how you can think about the project,
communicate it to yourself and to other stakeholders,
and make a plan.
