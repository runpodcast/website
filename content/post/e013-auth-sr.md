Got all your users logged in?  Now what?  Next level permissions with Roles, Attributes, and ACL.

<!--more-->

Permissions are often a part of "Auth" --- that's the Authorization bit.

How do you implement them?

Here are some of our favorites:

* Roles: A role attribute on a user allows them various levels of access
* Role Groups: A configuration of "role for group" attributes on a user allows them various levels of access
* Flags: A configuration of various flags on an account allows access
* ACL: Access Control Layer (ARO/ACR) granular control via a "grid" of permissions individually granted for each user via a complicated permissions join table.
