Learn about "auth" - both "authentication" and "authorization".
You *need* to get this right... But it's not that hard, these days.

<!--more-->

We talk about some of the pitfalls and best practices about this very important part of your application.

Here are a few of the topics discussed _(overviews at a fairly high level)_:

* User / Pass
* OAuth
* One way encryption
* Session

Also at the end Alan talks about [Meteor's Accounts](https://docs.meteor.com/api/accounts.html)
which is an excellent, working straight out of the box, option.

Of course, many frameworks offer an accounts/groups/roles/acl solution of some sort.
It's just that you can be playing with a fully functional and secure accounts system
_in under 10 minutes_ with Meteor.
