We're just a couple of guys, ya know? [_quote_](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Gag_Halfrunt)

Alan and Aaron have been web developers for several years.
We know each other from [Tech Meetups in Louisville KY](http://louisvilletech.org/).
Then we started mentoring together at [Code Louisville](https://www.codelouisville.org/).

While mentoring we decided that people who are new to programming have a lot of technical references,
guides to accomplish specific tasks,
but perhaps a lack of context for _why?_

We want to provide more context and discussion for various web-dev topics, at various skill levels.

We want to foster understanding and excitement for those who are new to development, to established developers, and for experts alike.

Got feedback? find us on [louisville slack](http://louisvilletech.org/) or google hangouts or IRL.

Got corrections? [make a PR](https://github.com/runpodcast/website).

Got love?  _perfect! that's our goal_
